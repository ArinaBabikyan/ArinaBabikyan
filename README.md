      <p>
        Built a <b>GRU-based multivariate time-series</b> weather forecasting model in <b>PyTorch</b> using hourly meteorological data, outperforming persistence baselines (MSE 8.999 vs. 10.249) and integrated the model into a <b>Django-based web application</b> for real-time East Coast weather prediction and visualization.

      <p>
        Researched factors, using statistical tests (<b>Mann-Whitney U, T-test in SciPy</b>), influencing the development of acute kidney injury in patients who underwent abdominal surgery and built a linear model achieving <b>0.94 predictability</b> for high-risk patient identification.
